Hi, I'm Tom, was born in '97, my life been so great to me, lemme tell you about it

- 3rd grade of junior high school, I started my first business by selling Thai's make up product and clothes for woman, also tried some MLM along the way, it run very smooth, it was quite hard because there was no "instagram ads" back then, so we need promote business by collaborating with another account with the same followers, like 5k+, 10k+, etc etc, did for 2 years.
- Last year of high school, I changed my business into making pomade to sell, we created it from scratch !! even cook it ourself and sell it online, we do it by also being a reseller for import/local pomade, we found it best so we can learn about pomade while selling our local stuffs, and did it for 1 year
- 2016, I learnt about cryptocurrency and was so interested on mining, finally building my own rig on 2017 and been running it since 2017 ! 
- also on 2017, I learn about trading and been doing it since
- 2019, I made a vape business by making a vape juice, it was a complete disaster, we ended up pivoting our strat and selling coil and cotton instead, and it works perfectly ! even better than the vape juice business, we also have 2 physical store and online store, become a distributor for 15++ vapestores all around Indonesia and running it until 2022.
- Now, 2022, I've been thinking about working with a company, letsgo !

Oh also, I graduated from Universitas Multimedia Nusantara, with S.Kom as my title, finished it on 3.43 GPA. which I never use lmao.
